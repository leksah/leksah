# Leksah, an Integrated Development Environment for Haskell

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/leksah/leksah.png?branch=vcs)](http://travis-ci.org/leksah/leksah)

This is [Leksah](http://leksah.org/), a hopefully practical tool to support the Haskell development process.

Leksah uses GTK+ as GUI Toolkit with the gtk2hs binding. It is plattform independend
and should run on any plattform where GTK+, gtk2hs and ghc can be installed.
It is currently been tested on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. It uses the Cabal package management
and build system for Package Management. It currently only supports the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (ghc).

Documentation can be found on [leksah.org](http://leksah.org/).

## System Requirements

Leksah currently requires:

* GHC
* gtk2hs
* For more details see the leksah.cabal file

To build the latest development version of Leksah follow the
steps in the [.travis.yml](.travis.yml) file.

If you are a user or just test Leksah, we would appreciate to hear from you.
