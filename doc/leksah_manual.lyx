\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for the programming
 language Haskell.
 It is written in Haskell and integrates the various tools available for
 writing programs in Haskell: the GHC compiler, the package management system
 ghc-pkg and CABAL (the Common Architecture for Building Applications and
 Libraries), Haddock for producing documentation, etc.
 in one, single, comprehensive and easy to use environment.
 It allows the developer to concentrate on writing the program and Leksah
 mamages the necessary housekeeping for compiling, linking and package managemen
t in the background.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A unified focus for translating source code to executable program: Leksah
 introduces the notion of a workspace that can include several packages
 transparently: to the programmer it appears as if there were a single program
 with a simple 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

make
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 command.
 Leksah mamages rebuilding and installing packages as far as necessary automatic
ally.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Support for writing source code: Leksah supports debugging with GHCi evaluation
 of expressions, gathering type information, setting breakpoints, displays
 values at breakpoints, etc.
 is all possible from within the Leksah window.
 Last, but not least, Leksah collects information about installed packages
 helps to find function names and their type and within an auto-completion
 featrure while you type new code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The features of Leksah often reflect closely and exposes features of the
 Haskell tools used; therefore, to understand behaviour in special case
 needs sometimes reading the specific documentation of GHC, Haddock, ghc-phg,
 or Cabal (and this manual, to a degree repeats what is found, with more
 detail and authority, in the respective tool documentation).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah is written in Haskell, which means the Leksah developers use Leksah
 to develop Leksah and users of Leksah can read the code and contribute
 improvements.
 Leksah uses internally existing tools for Haskell application development:
 GTK+ as GUI Toolkit with the gtk2hs binding.
 It is platform independent and runs on any platform where GTK+, gtk2hs
 and GHC can be installed.
 It has been tested on Linux, Windows and Mac.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This document is a reference to the functionality of Leksah, it is not intended
 to be a tutorial.
 Since Leksah is still under development the information may be incomplete
 or superseeded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current version prepared for the release of Leksah v.
 0.8 is not in all points up-to-date and has not been tested against for
 this version; an improved version will follow soon for v.0.8.1.

\begin_layout Subsection
Release Notes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Version 0.8 Release March 2010
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 0.8 release adds the notion of workspaces to allow develop comfortably
 projects, where part of the code is in separate packages.
 This changes the handling of packages to a degree, which has been improved
 with introducing suitable defaults: a simple, single-shot program can be
 started with very few clicks and entering not much more than the name of
 the program; Leksah becomes usable even for just quickly testing an idea...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 0.8 release introduces the concept of workspaces, that is intended to
 develop software broken in several packages, transparently as if there
 was a single package.
 Various other changes improve usability and stability of the platform.
 Notably is the split in a Leksah front-end and a Leksah-server.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
<<juergen expand and explain rational>>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A large number of bugs has been fixed, but there remain, probably a large
 number of, bugs - some old and not yet fixed and some new ones.
 We expect also to improve and streamline the user interface in the next
 minor release to achieve more consistency and make Leksah easier to learn.
 You may see comments to this effect in this document, suggesting possible
 changes in the interface.
 Your opinon on these and other possible improvements you see will be highly
 appreciated! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Version 0.8 works with GHC 6.10 
\series bold
and
\series default
 6.12.
 The installation is described here for the standard case (6.10.3 or 4, for
 which packages for gtk2hs are available), more details on installation
 are found in the appendix and continuously updated installation instruction
 on the wiki <<address missing>>.
 If you have any trouble installing, please check the Wiki, the mailing
 list or contact the developers to find a solution.
 A smooth implementation is a priority for us and we like to hear about
 difficulties you encounter to fix them; best report them on the bug and
 issues tracker <<address missing>>.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
We work on installers for Windows and Mac and packages for Debian/Ubuntu
 are in preparation.
 Help appreciated! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Version 0.6 Beta Release Juli 2009
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 0.6 version introduces an interpreter/debugger mode.
 This mode can be switched on and off from the toolbar.
 In interpreter/debugger mode expressions can be evaluated and the type
 of expressions can be dynamically shown.
 The GHCi debugger is integrated, so that breakpoints can be set, it is
 possible to step through the code, observe the values of variables and
 trace the execution history.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other features of Leksah like building in the background and reporting
 errors on the fly work in debugger mode as in compiler mode (but not configurin
g, installing, etc.
 of packages).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another new feature is integration of grep and text search with regular
 expression.
 This can be accessed from the findbar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GUI framework has been enhanced, so that layouts can be nested in so
 called group panes.
 This feature is used for the debugger pane.
 Furthermore notebooks can be detached, so that Leksah can be used on multiple
 screens.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A lot of little enhancements has been made and numerous bugs has been fixed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Known bugs and problems:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The package editor works only for cabal files without configurations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
MS Windows: The check for external modifications of source files does not
 work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
MS Windows: Interruption of a background build does not work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
GUI History still not working.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Traces pane of the Debugger does not work appropriately.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Version 0.4 Beta Release February/March 2009
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 0.4 Release is the first beta release of Leksah.
 It should be usable for practical work for the ones that wants to engage
 with it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It depends on GHC 
\begin_inset Formula $\geq$
\end_inset

6.10.1 and gtk2hs 
\begin_inset Formula $\geq$
\end_inset

 0.10.0.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The class pane and the history feature are not quite ready, so we propose
 not to use it yet.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Version 0.1 Alpha Release February 2008 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a pre-release of Leksah.
 The editor for Cabal Files is not ready, so we propose not to use it yet.

Installing Leksah
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
How to Install: Brief Instructions 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Install first: GHC 6.10 or 6.12 (the version that fits the gtk2hs package
 you can find; e.g.
 for windows currently this is 6.10.3)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gtk+
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
gtk2hs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
cabal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(for details about installing the above see the wiki).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then run cabal install leksah -- that is it! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you used a previous version of Leksah and experience difficulties, you
 may need to delete ICE files in your Leksah profile or in the folders you
 keep your sources.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Where Things Are Installed
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah installs a an executable in a folder that should be in the search
 path (on ubuntu /usr/local/bin, and a some of data files in a data folder
 (on ubunut in /usr/local/share/leksah-server-0.8).
 The locations are the regular ones, chosen by the Cabal package management
 system and depend on the target platform and the way you install.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For storing preferences, sessions and collected meta-data Leksah constructs
 a .leksah-0.8 directory in your home folder.
 If you want to change or add configuration files for keymaps, source candy,
 etc, you can put them in this place (see <<ref to configuration section>>).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
First Start
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first start of Leksah is in several steps, the first two occur only
 when you start the very first time:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You enter in a form information from you where your sources are (if you
 just want to test, you can just accept the defaults; corrections later
 are possible)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Leksah collects 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

metadata
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, i.e.
 exported symbols and their type, comments explaining them etc.
 from the Haskell sources (this step may take a while and no input will
 be expected from you during this)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The Leksah IDE starts regularly and you can work on the source code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Later starts will read in the previously collected metada and check quickly
 only for changes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Collection of Collect Metadata
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you start Leksah for the first time it must collect the information
 about the packages you have on your computer and may use in your projects.
 The first start dialog collects (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FirstStart-dialog"

\end_inset

) basic information from you where you keep your source program filesfiles.
 Leksah then collects information about exported symbols, their type and
 possible comments (collectively called metadata) to support your work,
 e.g.
 by suggestiong autocompletion and type information about functions you
 may use while you edit your source.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is recommended that you install the packages you use with the source
 code to allow Leksah to collect most complete information about the exported
 symbols, show you source comments for functions while auto-completing and
 will be navigate you to the sources of functions; installing with cabal
 install is all what is needed - the rest is done by Leksah automatically
 for most packages (for some packages, which perform special magic, like
 generating header files or such, additional steps may be necessary - but
 without such steps, Leksah is usable, but may not give you always all the
 type information you would like).

\begin_layout Standard
In the first start dialog you are aksed for:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
the location of folders, where Haskell source code for installed packages
 can be found (this can be any folder above the source directories).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
the cabal install folder, where cabal keeps the .tar files package directory,
 (on ubuntu in ~/.cabal/packages/).
 Leksah decompresses and untars the sources and scans them to collect metadata.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah collects information about all installed packages on your system
 that will take some time (minutes to half an hour) the first time.
 Errors occuring in this metadata collectio step indicate only that Leksah
 has not succeeded to extract the source locations and comments from a module
 or package; they are not consequential, except that some metainformation
 may be missing.
 The metada is cached and future starts only scan newly installed packages,
 starts only information for new packages will be installed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
<<check above for redundancy>>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
First Start of the IDE
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After starting up, Leksah will open its Main window in a standard configuration
 (

\end_inset

).
 <<needs new screenshot>>
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah organizes your code in packages.
 A package is a set of files that are compiled together and produces an
 executable program (or a library) by Cabal.
 Cabal manages compilation, linking, etc.
 and needs details about your project, e.g.
 which the name of the module with the main, the packages used etc.
 as you would normally specify on a the ghc command.
 This information is conveniently collected in a programname.cabal file.
 Cabal is indispensable for multi-file programs and its value is demonstrated
 especially when you recompile and run a program later after a long interruption
 in your work.
 Normal use of cabal seems a heavy overhead for one-shot, single file mini
 Haskell programs but Leksah reduces this enormously.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You have two ways to progress on your first contact with Leksah:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
One way to start up, and probably the best way if you already have experience
 with Haskell, will be to open an existing project.
 So select Package/OpenPackage from the menu and open a Cabal file of some
 project.
 A typical Leksah window may then look like 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Workspace -> New.
 Starts a new workspace and give it a name (e.g.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Click on the Modules tab in the top right pane (this is like the class browser
 in visual studio).
 Right click and select Add Module.
 Put “Main” in the New Module box.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Now the source opens and you add to the module skeleton

 haskell program with Leksah.
 It is as easy as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

Remember: the project folder is the folder in which your .cabal file for
 the project is stored.
 A workspace is thus the union of the folders in which the cabal files,
 which are listed in the workspace pane are stored.
 It is not a real folder and in one folder (mine is ~/workspaces) several
 virtual Leksah workspaces may coexist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of the time programming ist spent in editing source code.
 To edit Haskell source files Leksah uses the GtkSourceView2 widget for
 this.
 It provides editing, undo/redo, syntax highlighting and similar features.
 In the file menu (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:File-menu"

\end_inset

) you find the customary functionality to open, save, close and revert files.
 To avoid confusion, it is useful to be able to close all files, or all
 files which are not stored in or below the top folder of the current project
 (this is the folder where the .cabal file resides) at once - this helps
 you focus on your project.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah does not store backup files.
 Leksah detects if a file which is currently edited has changed on disk
 and queries the user if a reload is desired.
 When you open a file which is already open, a dialog pops up to inquire
 if you want to make the currently open file active, instead of opening
 it a second time (Leksah does not support multiple views on a file, but
 if you open a file a second time, it's like editing the file two times,
 which makes little sense).
 The list of files is shown as notebook tabs (on top or left of the files
 - as you prefer (Menu -> View -> Tabs Left)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
<<why not just go to the file - i see no use for this>>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a file has changed compared to the stored version, the file name is
 shown in red in the notebook tab, reminding you that it needs to be saved

\end_inset

).
 Pressing the up and down arrow will bring you to the next/previous occurrence
 of the search string.
 Hitting Enter has a similar effect as the down arrow.
 Hitting Escape will closes the find bar and sets the cursor to the current
 find position.
 You have options for case sensitive search (labeled

This is done by replacing certain character combinations by a Unicode character
 when loading a file or when typing, and replace it back when the file is
 saved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The use of the candy feature can be switched on and off in the menu and

The first entry in a line are the characters to replace.
 The second entry is the hexadecimal representation of the Unicode character

 The third entry is an optional argument, which specifies, that the replacement

 This is important because of the layout feature of Haskell.
 The last entry in the line is an optional comment, which is by convention
 the name of the Unicode character.

 Haskell organizes software projects in packages, which are managed independentl
y.
 A package is compiled and linked as a unit to produce an executable and
 the library -- if it produces one -- is installed in the package manager
 (ghc-pkg).
 A package can be put into Hackage or packages from other are downloaded
 in the Hackage.
 Packages have version and cabal assures that a packages is compiled and
 with other packages which of the correct version.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The difficulties when working with a project where source code under development
 is spread over several packages are overcome in Leksah with the concept
 of a workspace, combining several packages and allowing smooth working
 with files from all packages.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
<<Workspaces are new in version 0.8 and the interface described is tentative
 and may change in following releases>> 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah always works in a workspace and always uses a package.
 This seems overkill for very simple projects, where the workspace contains
 just one package and this package just one source module producing one
 executable, but Leksah provides defaults (new in 0.8) that reduce the effort
 to a minimum and we have shown (in <<ref missing>>) that the overhead for
 workspace and packages is actually minimal for one-shot projects, e.g., for
 quickly testing an idea independent from other codes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The principle always to work in a workspace and in a package is beneficial
 in the long run, because it gives a smooth transition from a one-shot idea
 to a complex projects and integrates the widely used cabal system fully.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
File Organization with Workspaces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
<<what is the uniform style for writing file names? is there a code macro
 in LyX>>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A workspace is represented by a file (
\emph on
workspace_name.lkshws
\emph default
) in a directory; I use a directory 
\emph on
workspaces
\emph default
, where all my Haskell work is collected.
 This workspace directory contains the folders for the packages.
 Each contains a label file (
\emph on
packagename.cabal
\emph default
) and typically folders for the source files, following the usual Haskell
 ghc convention of hierarchical module names.
 Other organizations are, of course, possible.
 You may, for example, have a workspace folder for each Leksah workspace.
 You have to use care when you create a new workspace file (and if you do
 not like the result, delete the 
\emph on
workspace.lkshws
\emph default
 file)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cabal then controls the compilation and linking with GHC and puts the results
 in a dist folder in the package; this folder is reconstructed often and
 may be deleted without loss.
 In the folder package_name/dist/build/executable_name you find the executable,
 but it is also installed in the folder ~/.cabal/bin (which you may put on
 your search path).

\begin_layout Standard
<<the defaults here are seemingly always inside the last package, which

 to get the pop-up menu to add a package by selecting the corresponding
 cabal file.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Open workspace
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A workspace is preserved between runs of Leksah.
 When starting, Leksah opens the last workspace used automatically when
 starting.
 you can change to another workspace like opening it by selecting the correspond
ing workspace file or choosing in the list of recently used workspaces.

\begin_layout Subsection
Packages
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The concept of a package is used to handle a unit of work for the development
 of some library or executable.
 It is, in the first place, the unit Cabal deals with and is a standard
 in the Haskell community.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah stores configurations for packages separately in the standard cabal
 files.
 The same files can be used outside of leksah: for example, you can issue
 the command cabal install in the folder that contains the cabal file and
 cabal will (as it would inside leksah) configures, compiles and links and
 install or register the library produce (if an).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah, in addition to using cabal for packages, saves the state of your
 work environment in the package: you can switch between packages and get
 exactly back to where you stopped working when leaving the package: the
 same files open in editors and the cursor in the same file and position.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Opening and closing a package
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah uses Cabal for package management, and opening a package is done
 by opening the corresponding .
\emph on
cabal
\emph default
 file.
 So when you select Package / Open Package from the menu, select the *.cabal
 file of the desired package - it is the cabal file in the folder with the
 package files; the name can be arbitrary, but you must not have more than
 one *.cabal file in a folder!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah shows the currently active package in the third compartment in the
 status bar and in the window title.
 The package file contains appropriate defaults and for a small program,
 you may just save and close it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 the same name you will give to your package in the package editor (see
 <<next>>).
 Then the package editor will open to collect the package details.

Package editor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The package editor (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

) is an editor for cabal files and but you can edit the cabal files in your
 regular text editor.
 Leksah works (usually) with the cabal files you and others have already
 written, for example those you get when you install a package from Hackage.
 Since cabal files offer complex options the editor offers many separate
 sub-panes in a list on the right.
 For a complete description of all options see the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href

\begin_layout Standard
<<is this still true - what is exactly the limitation now?>>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The package editor does currently not support the cabal configurations feature
 (but it does flags, in a separate pane <<see xx>>).
 If you need cabal configurations, you need to edit the cabal files as a
 text file separately.
 Leksah uses standard cabal files with no modifications this is no problem
 just the package editor will not work for you.

The most important parts of cabal files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A package has, as a minimal requirement, a 
\bar under
name
\bar default
 and a 
\bar under
version
\bar default
 (default is 0.0.1 -- meaning something like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

first idea
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 If your code uses other packages then they must be listed in 
\bar under
dependencies
\bar default
.
 This will be at least the 
\emph on
base
\emph default
 package (which is entered by default).
 This is independent whether you downloaded them, e.g., from Hackage produced
 them yourself.
 Version numbers are used to document (and enforce) that older versions
 of a program use the corresponding older versions of other packages with
 which it was developed originally.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The result of the packages can be an executable and you enter the name of
 the Haskell file that contains the main function in the executable pane
 and the name of the executable.
 The result of the package can be a library; in the corresponding pane you
 tick off the modules which should be exposed (i.e., their exports can be
 used in other packages).
 Cabal gives the possibility to build more then one executable from one
 package and to build a library and executables from one package.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For an executable you can, but usually need not, specify build info.
 With build information you give additional 
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

information, e.g: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_layout Standard
Because more then one executable and a library can be build from one package,
 it is possible to have cabal files with more then one build info.
 The package editor deals with this by the buttons Add / Remove Build Info.
 Every build info gets an index number, and for executables and a library
 you specify the index of the build info.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Initializing a package: Clean and configure operations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before a package can be acted on it must be configured; you may clean a
 package (i.e., delete its 
\emph on
dist
\emph default
 folder) to start afresh.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Configure checks that the packages the current packages depend on are installed
 in GHC package manager; it checks for name and version, if you specify
 them.
 If an Hackage package is missing, you can 
\noun on
cabal install
\noun default
 it in a terminal window.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two types of errors regarding packages may be reported:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While configuring, Cabal checks that the packages you have listed in the
 depends on section are installed on your computer.
 If one of your packages is missing (or missing the version that is needed)
 you can install it either -- for packages you have the source on your computer,
 e.g.
 because you wrote them -- by switching Leksah to the folder where this
 package is and configure, build and install them with the command 
\emph on
cabal install
\emph default
.
 For packages that are on hackage -- use a console, go to the directory
 where you keep such sources and type cabal install packageName (possibly
 package_name-version); cabal then recursively installs the package and
 all packages it depends on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Separate from this error message the case, where the compiler misses a module
 you want to import.
 Leksah provides an error message, indicating what package you have to add
 to the depends on' section in the cabal file.
 Edit the package, add the dependency and do configure/build (possibly you
 have to cabal install the package as well, if you get the error described
 above).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Building
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most frequently used functionality with packages is to make a build,
 which is possible after a successful configure.
 When you start a build, you can see the standard output of the Cabal build
 procedure in the Log pane.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A build may produce errors and warnings.
 If this is the case the focus is set to the first error/warning in the
 Log and the corresponding source file will open with the focus at the point
 where the compiler reports the error.
 You can navigate to the next or previous errors by clicking on the error
 or warning in the log window, or by using the menu, the toolbar or a keystroke.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the statusbar the state regarding to the build is displayed in the third
 compartment from the right.
 It reads 
\emph on
Building
\emph default
 as long as a build is on the way and displays the numbers of errors and
 warnings after a build.

Cabal needs the --user flag (which is set by default in Leksah) to install
 the result of a built in the user space.
 The --user flag makes achieves that using cabal within leksah or from the
 command line has the same effect and puts your library and executables
 in the same place (the alternative is --global to put the resulting files
 in global space in ghc-pkg).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Haddock documentation for the leksah source will not be build, because it
 is not a library unless you pass the --executable flag.
 The flags are stored in a file called IDE.flags in the root folder of the

A frequent and annoying error is the

 In the majority of cases it means that an import statement is missing and
 to write import statements is a frequent and annoying task.
 In Leksah if the compiler informs about a missing import, you can choose
 
\emph on
Add import 
\emph default
from the context menu in the log pane.
 Leksah will then add an import statement to the import list.
 If there is more then one module that exports this identifier, a dialog

Leksah collects data about the exported modules of all installed Haskell
 packages on your system looking in your cabal directory and the source
 directories you listed in the preferences.
 It does this by reading the Haskell interface files .hi files (from GHC).
 The package you work <<??all packages in the workspace>> on is treated
 differently, as not only external exported entities are collected, but
 all exports from all modules are collected.

Metadata collection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Remember, that metadata is the data Leksah has collected from all the Haskell
 code (including .hi files for installed packages) it could reach on your
 computer.
 This is a relatively slow process; when Leksah starts, it checks only for
 changes, but does not scan all files again.
 Metadata collection depends on the local configuration, especially the
 list of places where Haskell code may be found, which is entered in the
 preferences <<see>>.
 Occasionally, you may find it gets confused and metadata collection needs
 to be redone.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Metadata collection can be manually triggered: If you select
\emph on
 Update Project
\emph default
 in the configuration menu, the metadata for the current project is collected
 from the .hi files and the source files.
 This brings the metadata of the current project up-to-date.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you select 
\emph on
configuration -> update system data -> Update Lib Leksah
\emph default
 checks, if a new library has installed and then collects metadata from
 additions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The metadata collection itself proceeds in two steps: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Extract info from .hi files, produced by GHC.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Add source locations and comments by parsing the sources using Haddock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It works as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Packages you installed with cabal from Hackage: Since 
\emph on
cabal install
\emph default
 keeps sources as compressed tar archives on your machine, Leksah needs
 to unpack them.
 You can see if this works by browsing the folders.
 You can initiate this step by starting in a terminal with 
\emph on
leksah -x - n
\emph default
 (means eXtract and NoGUI).
 If files cannot be opened because permission is denied, you most likely
 installed the packages as root (with, e.g., sudo); then only root has write
 access to some cabal packages and you need: 
\emph on
sudo leksah -x -n
\emph default
 (or 
\emph on
--Extract --NoGui
\emph default
).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Source files in a folder in the folders listed as source folder in the preferenc
es <<see>>: Leksah looks for all .cabal files it can find below the source
 folders.
 Therefore, Leksah collects source information only from 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Cabalized
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 projects (i.e., projects that have a .cabal file).
 From this information the file source_packages.txt in the .leksah folder
 is written.
 If you miss sources for a package in Leksah, consult this file if the source
 place of the package has been correctly found.
 You can run this step by typing in a terminal: 
\emph on
leksah -s -n
\emph default
 (or 
\emph on
--Sources --NoGui
\emph default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A problem may occur due to preprocessing, header files, language extensions,
 etc.
 Error message produced while metadata collection indicate that not all
 information for a package was found are not consequential for future use
 of Leksah.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The result of metadata collection is stored in a folder in the .leksah-0.8
 folder (in your home folder).
 The folder is named after the compiler version (e.g., ghc-6.10.4).
 In this folder for every package a metadata file is stored (e.g.
 binary-0.4.1.lkshm).
 These files are in binary format.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can rebuild the whole metadata when you start Leksah in a terminal with
 the -r -n option (--Rebuild --NoGui), or you can update the metadata with:
 leksah -c -n (--Collect --NoGui).
 If you have a problem with a certain package, remove its metadata file,
 and collect the data afresh with Leksah -c -n.
 (Look for error messages in the console to see if some problem is reported).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the current package a slightly different procedure is used, as for the
 current package, not only symbols for exported library entities, but for
 all exports of every module are considered.

Leksah is highly customizable and can be adapted to your specific needs
 and work organization.
 What follows here is not needed for initial use of Leksah (and need not
 be read on a first lecture of the manual).
 Leksah works well with the default settings and a desire to adapt better
 to your work habits comes only with extended use of Leksah -- the settings
 in the preferences are there, if and when you need them (see --).
 However, with time, you may use one or the other option to tailor Leksah
 to your personal preference.
 It is easy! Here it is explained how this works.

Leksah shows typically a layout as fig <<missing>> and the current is in
 one of the panes, which is then called the active pane and its name is
 displayed in the second compartment from the left side in the status bar.
 The big pane the the right typically contain the editor buffers to the
 open files and the pane on the right is split in an upper an lower part,
 housing special information panes.
 Some actions like moving, splitting, closing panes or finding or replacing
 items in a text buffer act on the current pane, so check the display in
 the status bar to see if the pane you want to act on, is really the active
 one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can tailor the layout with the View menu to suit your work style better.
 Internally, the panes are arranged in a tree (this is a gtk design) and
 with the commands to change the layout, you manipulate this tree.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the initial pane positions part of the Preferences, you can configure
 the placement of panes.
 Panes belongs to categories, and a category specify a path were a pane
 will open (

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The layout of the Leksah window contains areas which contain notebooks which
 contain panes.
 The division between the two areas is adjustable by the user by dragging
 a handle.
 The areas form a binary tree (Gtk+ layout rules).
 Every area can be split horizontally or vertically and panes can collapse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
<<redundancy>>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Panes can be moved between areas in the window.
 This can be done by dragging the notebook tab, and release it on the frame
 of another notebook.
 Alternatively you can use keystrokes (Shift Alt Arrow) to move panes around.
 The tabs of notebooks can be positioned at any of the four directions,
 or the tabs can be switched off.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that holding the mouse over the tabs and selecting the right button
 brings up a menu of all panes in this area, so that you can for example

Advanced layout: Group panes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A notebook cannot only contain single panes, but it can as well contain
 group panes, which have a layout on their own and may contain arbitrary
 other panes; the debug pane is an example for a group pane.
 This gives you the possibility to arrange the subpanes in a debugger pane
 as it fits you best.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A new group starts by selecting 
\noun on
View / Group 
\noun default
from the menu.
 You have to give a unique name for the group.
 Then you can arrange panes in the group as you like.
 When closing a group, and the group is not empty, you have to confirm it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Using Leksah with multiple displays: Detached windows
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This feature allows you to move panes to a separate window on a separate
 display.
 This is as simple as: You select a notebook and choose 
\noun on
View / Detach
\noun default
 from the menu bar.
 Then the notebook is opened in a new window, which you can then move to
 another screen.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you close the detached window, the pane goes back to the place where
 it was before detaching.
 The state of detached window is remembered, when you close Leksah, and
 they will be reopened when you restart Leksah.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to drag and drop panes between windows.
 But splitting and collapsing of panes is disabled for detached windows.
 So a recommended way to use this feature is to split a pane, arrange the
 panes that you want to detach in the area of the new notebook.
 Select the new notebook and detach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The detached windows have no menu bar, toolbar and status bar on their own.
 This may be a problem, when you want to select a menu entry: the focus
 changes from a pane in the detached window to a pane in the main window,
 and you may not be able to do what you want.
 We recommend that you use keystrokes or context menus.

 in the 
\emph on
~/.leksah
\emph default
 folder.
 <<changed in 0.8 but not yet updated here>> A session contains the layout
 of the window, its content, the active package and some other state.
 When you restart Leksah it recovers the state from this information.
 When you close a package, the session is saved in the project folder in
 the file 
\emph on
current.lksks
\emph default
.
 When you open a project and Leksah finds a 
\emph on
current.lksks
\emph default
 file in the folder of the project you are going to open, you get prompted
 if you want to open this session (this means mostly opening the files you
 had open before in the editor).
 This helps you to switch between different packages you are working on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, sessions can be stored and loaded with a name manually by using
 the session menu, but the need to use these features occurs rarely.
 The menu Configuration -> Forget Session is useful if you inadvertently
 changed the layout drastically and do not want the current session to be
 stored.

\begin_layout Standard
You can configure the keystrokes by providing a .keymap file, which should
 be be in the ~/.leksah-0.8 folder.
 The name of the key map file to be used can be specified in the Preferences
 dialog (without extension!).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A line in the .keymap file looks like (for details see Appendix <<xx>>):

\begin_layout Standard
Description of the key or key combination: Allowed modifiers are <shift>
 <ctrl> <alt> <apple> <compose>.
 <apple> is on a Microsoft keyboard the windows key (and on a Mac, obviously,
 the apple key!).
 <compose> is right ALT key, often labeled Alt Gr.
 It is as well possible to specify Emacs like keystrokes in the following
 way: <ctrl>x/<ctrl>f -> FileOpen "Opens an existing file"
\end_layout

\emph default
.
 The comment following will be displayed as tool tip for the toolbar button,
 if one exists for this action.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every keystroke must at most be associated with one action, and every action
 may only have one associated keystroke.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simple keystrokes are shown in the menu, but Emacs like keystrokes are not.
 This is because simple keystrokes are handled by the standard GTK mechanism,
 while other keystrokes are handled by Leksah.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Independently how you initiated an action, by a menu, a toolbar button or
 a keystroke, the keystroke with its associated ActionsString is displayed
 in the Status bar in the leftmost compartment.

Leksah stores its configuration in a directory called ~/.leksah-0.7 under
 your home folder.
 Indexing the hidden Leksah directory with the version number avoids that
 changes to preferences file layout from version to version cause difficulties.
 Moving your preferences from a previous version is automatic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If no preference file is found in your the .leksah-0.8 folder in your home
 directory, then the global prefs.lkshp will be used.
 Sometimes a preference file get corrupted, which means leksah does not
 start; it is then often sufficient to just delete the preference file and
 start afresh.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Current.session file stores the state of the last session, so that Leksah
 will recover the state from the last session.
 If this file is not available it will be taken from the installed /data
 folder.
 Here applies the same: if Leksah has a problem starting, delete the session
 file (and delete the session file before you delete the preference file).

\begin_layout Standard
The source_packages.txt file stores source locations for installed packages.
 It can be rebuild by calling Leksah in a terminal with the -s or --Sources
 argument .
 Do this after you moved your source or added sources for previous installed
 packages without sources.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The folder will contain one or other folders named after the computer used
 (e.g.
 ghc-6.8.1).
 In this folder collected information about installed packages for a compiler
 version is stored.
 (e.g.
 binary-0.4.1.pack).
 These files are in binary format.
 If you start Leksah with the -r or --Rebuild argument, it cleans all .pack
 files and rebuilds everything.You can use the command in the configuration
 menu <<see above>>; be aware that collecting all the information takes
 considerable time (say half an hour, for me).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Files for Keymaps and SourceCandy for details see appendix xx may be stored
 in the ~/.leksah folder and will be found according to the name selected
 in the Preferences Dialog.
 Leksah first searches in this folder and after this in the /data folder.

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On operating systems with package managers you may find that a Cabal package
 is available.
 Once again if you want good Metadata for the Cabal functions, try to build
 binaries on your machine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Install Gtk2Hs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the time of writing Leksah supports only the most current version (0.10.*).
 For information about installing Gtk2Hs got to 
\begin_inset Flex URL

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://haskell.org/gtk2hs
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are planning on installing a newer version, then you will need to
 make sure it is compatible with the version of GHC you have installed first.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On operating systems with a package manager you may wish to use a source
 OS package and build a binary OS package to install.
 You should be able to prevent the working directory from being cleaned,
 so it can be used for Leksah's Metadata.
 Doing this means that other OS packages depending on Gtk2Hs can still easily
 be installed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you compile Gtk2Hs manually, check the output of ./configure.
 At the end it will list the Haskell packages that are going to be build.
 Leksah needs GTK, glib and gtksourceview2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gtk2Hs conditionally compiles some code dependent of the version of the
 underlying GTK libraries.
 This can cause strange compiler errors when compiling Leksah later.
