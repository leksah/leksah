\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for the programming
 language Haskell.
 It is written in Haskell and integrates the various tools available for
 writing programs in Haskell: the GHC compiler, the package management system
 ghc-pkg and CABAL (the Common Architecture for Building Applications and
 Libraries), Haddock for producing documentation, etc.
 in one, single, comprehensive and easy to use environment.
 It allows the developer to concentrate on writing the program and Leksah
 manages the necessary housekeeping for compiling, linking and package managemen
t in the background.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A unified focus for translating source code to executable program: Leksah
 introduces the notion of a workspace that can include several packages
 transparently: to the programmer it appears as if there were a single program
 with a simple 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

make
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 command.
 Leksah manages rebuilding and installing packages as far as desired automatical
ly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Support for writing source code: Leksah supports debugging with GHCi evaluation
 of expressions, gathering type information, setting breakpoints, displays
 values at breakpoints, etc.
 is all possible from within the Leksah window.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Last, but not least, Leksah collects information about installed packages,
 helps to find function names and their type and offers an auto-completion
 feature while you type new code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The features of Leksah often reflect closely and exposes features of the
 Haskell tools used; therefore, to understand behavior in special case needs
 sometimes reading the specific documentation of GHC, Haddock, ghc-pkg,
 or Cabal (and this manual, to a degree repeats what is found, with more
 detail and authority, in the respective tool documentation).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah is written in Haskell, which means the Leksah developers use Leksah
 to develop Leksah and users of Leksah can read the code and contribute
 improvements.
 Leksah uses internally existing tools for Haskell application development:
 GTK+ as GUI Toolkit with the gtk2hs binding.
 It is platform independent and runs on any platform where GTK+, gtk2hs
 and GHC can be installed.
 It has been tested on Linux, Windows and Mac.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This document is a reference to the functionality of Leksah, it is not intended
 to be a tutorial.
 Since Leksah is still under development the information may be incomplete
 or superseded.

\begin_layout Subsection
Release Notes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Version 0.8 Release March 2010
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 0.8 release adds the notion of workspaces to allow develop comfortably
 projects, where part of the code is in separate packages.
 This changes the handling of packages to a degree, which has been improved
 with introducing suitable defaults: a simple, single-shot program can be
 started with very few clicks and entering not much more than the name of
 the program; Leksah becomes usable even for just quickly testing an idea.
 Other changes include:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Better metadata with non exported definitions for workspace packages
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Support for prebuild metadata packages
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Better completion (keywords, language extensions, module name, non exported
 definitions)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Splittet in a client and server part (Client part doesn't import ghc-api)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Added support for Ghc 6.12
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Prepared for Yi (Abstract TextEditor interface, not ready for use)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Various other changes improve usability and stability of the platform.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A large number of bugs has been fixed, but there remain, probably a large
 number of, bugs - some old and not yet fixed and some new ones.
 We expect also to improve and streamline the user interface in the next
 minor release to achieve more consistency and make Leksah easier to learn.
 You may see comments to this effect in this document, suggesting possible
 changes in the interface.
 Your opinion on these and other possible improvements you see will be highly
 appreciated! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Version 0.8 works with GHC 6.10 and 6.12.
 The installation is described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand prettyref
reference "sec:Installing-Leksah"

\end_inset

 for the standard case, more up to date information on installation may
 be found on the Wiki 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "haskell.org/haskellwiki/Leksah"
target "http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Leksah"

\end_inset

.
 If you have any trouble installing, please check the Wiki, the forum or
 contact the developers to find a solution.
 A smooth implementation is a priority for us and we like to hear about
 difficulties you encounter to fix them; please report them on the bug and
 issues tracker

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Version 0.6 Beta Release Juli 2009
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 0.6 version introduces an interpreter/debugger mode.
 This mode can be switched on and off from the toolbar.
 In interpreter/debugger mode expressions can be evaluated and the type
 of expressions can be dynamically shown.
 The GHCi debugger is integrated, so that breakpoints can be set, it is
 possible to step through the code, observe the values of variables and
 trace the execution history.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other features of Leksah like building in the background and reporting
 errors on the fly work in debugger mode as in compiler mode (but not configurin
g, installing, etc.
 of packages).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another new feature is integration of grep and text search with regular
 expression.
 This can be accessed from the findbar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GUI framework has been enhanced, so that layouts can be nested in so
 called group panes.
 This feature is used for the debugger pane.
 Furthermore notebooks can be detached, so that Leksah can be used on multiple
 screens.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A lot of little enhancements has been made and numerous bugs has been fixed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Known bugs and problems:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The package editor works only for cabal files without configurations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
MS Windows: The check for external modifications of source files does not
 work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
MS Windows: Interruption of a background build does not work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
GUI History still not working.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Traces pane of the Debugger does not work appropriately.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Version 0.4 Beta Release February/March 2009
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 0.4 Release is the first beta release of Leksah.
 It should be usable for practical work for the ones that wants to engage
 with it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It depends on GHC 
\begin_inset Formula $\geq$
\end_inset

6.10.1 and gtk2hs 
\begin_inset Formula $\geq$
\end_inset

 0.10.0.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The class pane and the history feature are not quite ready, so we propose
 not to use it yet.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Version 0.1 Alpha Release February 2008 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a pre-release of Leksah.
 The editor for Cabal Files is not ready, so we propose not to use it yet.

Post Installation steps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Until the next release of gtk2hs, for a pleasant visual appearance, you
 have to copy or append the .gtkrc-2.0 file from the Leksah data folder or
 from the data folder in Leksah sources to your home folder.
 If you miss the step, the cross [x] buttons on tabs are almost invisible
 (or don't fit in tabs).
 This step may become obsolete during the 0.8 release cycle.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout LyX-Code
cd ~ 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

wget http://code.haskell.org/leksah/leksah/data/.gtkrc-2.0 -O .gtkrc-2.0-leksah
\begin_inset Newline newline

echo -e '
\backslash
ninclude ".gtkrc-2.0-leksah"' >> .gtkrc-2.0 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
It has been observed, that a package recache is often necessary after installati
on.
 The symptom is an empty Module Browser, if you select the System scope.
 So simply do:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout LyX-Code
ghc-pkg recache
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Subsection
First start of Leksah
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first start of Leksah proceeds in several steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You enter in a form information from you where your sources are (if you
 just want to test, you can just accept the defaults; corrections later
 are possible)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Leksah collects 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

metadata
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, i.e.
 exported symbols and their type, comments explaining them etc.
 for all installed packages on your machine.
 This step may take a while and may give no feedback or a lot of strange
 errors and warnings, don't worry but be patient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The Leksah IDE starts regularly and you can work on the source code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Later starts will read in the previously collected metadata and check quickly
 only for changes.
 After starting up, Leksah will open its Main window in a standard configuration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Progress on your first contact with Leksah:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Start with the, infamous, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hello World
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 example.
 The next section gives you a step by step description.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Then it might be the best to construct a workspace and add an existing project
 and explore Leksah while you work on it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
First start dialog
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you start Leksah for the first time it must collect the information
 about the packages you have on your computer and may use in your projects.
 The first start dialog collects (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FirstStart-dialog"

\end_inset

) basic information from you where you keep your source program files.
 Leksah then collects information about exported symbols, their type and
 possible comments (collectively called metadata) to support your work,
 e.g.
 by suggesting auto-completion and type information about functions you
 may use while you edit your source.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is recommended that you install the packages you use with the source
 code to allow Leksah to collect most complete information about the exported
 symbols, show you source comments for functions while auto-completing and
 will be navigate you to the sources of functions; installing with cabal
 install is all what is needed - the rest is done by Leksah automatically
 for most packages (for some packages, which perform special magic, like
 generating header files or such, additional steps may be necessary - but
 without such steps, Leksah is usable, but may not give you always all the
 type information you would like).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the first start dialog you are asked for:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
the location of folders, where Haskell source code for installed packages
 can be found (this can be any folder above the source directories).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
the cabal install folder, where cabal keeps the .tar files package directory,
 (on Ubuntu in ~/.cabal/packages/).
 Leksah decompresses and untars the sources and scans them to collect metadata.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah collects information about all installed packages on your system
 that will take some time (minutes to half an hour) the first time.
 Errors occuring in this metadata collectio step indicate only that Leksah
 has not succeeded to extract the source locations and comments from a module
 or package; they are not consequential, except that some metainformation
 may be missing.
 The metada is cached and future starts only scan newly installed packages,
 starts only information for new packages will be installed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
<<check above for redundancy>>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Where Things Are Installed
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah installs a an executable in a folder that should be in the search
 path (on ubuntu /usr/local/bin, and a some of data files in a data folder
 (on Ubuntu in /usr/local/share/leksah-server-0.8).
 The locations are the regular ones, chosen by the Cabal package management
 system and depend on the target platform and the way you install.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For storing preferences, sessions and collected meta-data Leksah constructs
 a .leksah-0.8 directory in your home folder.
 If you want to change or add configuration files for keymaps, source candy,
 etc, you can put them in this place.
\end_layout

Hello World example
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Workspace -> New.
 Constructs a new workspace in a selected folder and give it a name (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hello
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 This produces a file Hello.lkshw.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Package -> New and use the "Create Folder" button to make a new folder for
 the package.
 Make sure to be in this folder when you click 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Open
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 An editor opens up, which let you edit cabal files.
 The name proposed for your package is the name of the folder you just construct
ed.
 That is the convention with Cabal packages.
 The defaults are set for creating a simple executable.
 The base package is specified as build dependencies, and an executable
 with the name of the package will be constructed.
 The main module resides in a file 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Main.hs
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The sources are in a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

src
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 subdirectory of the packages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Click Save to write the .cabal file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The main module gets automatically constructed and opens.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Now add your code to the module 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout LyX-Code

\emph on
main = putStrLn "Hello World" .
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
By default, auto build is on and you can see that the file will be compiled
 in the Log pane.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Choose Package -> Run or ctrl-alt-r, and you will see Hello World in the
 Log pane.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Or: Choose Package -> Install, open a Shell and try out your newly created
 executable 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Congratulations ! you have now entered, compiled, linked and run your first
 Haskell program with Leksah.
 It is as easy as: Create workspace / New package / enter your code/ Run.
 Remember: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the project folder is the folder in which your .cabal file for the project
 is stored.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A workspace is just a file, which contain information about included packages.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Output will be in the Log window.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can add Packages with the context menu in the workspace pane.
 You can construct new packages with Package -> New, from the menubar.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can add other modules by selecting 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Add module
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from the context menu of the modules pane of the browser group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can open panes you need by selecting Panes -> Browser | Log | ...
 from the menubar.

\begin_layout Standard
Most of the time programming is editing source code.
 To edit Haskell source files Leksah uses the GtkSourceView2 widget.
 It provides editing, undo/redo, syntax highlighting and similar features.
 In the file menu (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:File-menu"

\end_inset

) you find the customary functionality to open, save, close and revert files.
 To avoid confusion, it is useful to be able to close all files, or all
 files which are not stored in or below the top folder of the current project
 (this is the folder where the .cabal file resides) at once - this helps
 you focus on your project.
 This way it is as well possible to close all files, which don't belong
 to a workspace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah does not store backup files.
 Leksah detects if a file which is currently edited has changed on disk
 and queries the user if a reload is desired.
 (Attention: This don't currently work for Windows, so take care).
 When you open a file which is already open, a dialog pops up to inquire
 if you want to make the currently open file active, instead of opening
 it a second time (Leksah does not support multiple views on a file, but
 if you open a file a second time, it's like editing the file two times,
 which makes little sense).
 The list of files is shown as notebook tabs (on top or left of the files
 - as you prefer (Menu -> View -> Tabs Left).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a file has changed compared to the stored version, the file name is
 shown in red in the notebook tab, reminding you that it needs to be saved
 before compilation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want to change to a different file editor buffer you can open a list
 of all open files by pressing the right mouse button, while the mouse is
 over a notebook tab.
 You can then select an entry in this list to select this file.
 (See 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Using-the-Flipper"

\end_inset

 for a better way to switch between source files).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the right side in the status bar at the bottom you can see the line and
 column, in which the cursor currently is; and if overwrite mode is switched
 on.
 In the second compartment from the left you can see the currently active
 pane, which is helpful if you want to be sure that you have selected the
 right pane for some operation.

In the edit menu (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

) you find the usual operations: undo, redo, cut, copy, paste and select
 all.
 In addition you can comment and un-comment selected lines in a per line
 style (--); however, the comment symbol must start in the first column
 (beware of illegal sequences like --# which may be automatically produced
 by inserting a comment in front of some symbol).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Selected blocks of code can be shifted left or right using the tab or Tab/Shift-
Tab keys.
 Furthermore, you can align some special characters (=,<-,->,::,|) in selected
 lines.
 The characters are never moved to the left, but the operation is very simple
 and takes the rightmost position of the special character in all lines,
 and inserts spaces before the first occurrence of this special characters
 in the other lines for alignment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Find and Replace in the current folder
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah supports searching in text files.
 When you select Edit/Find from the menu the find bar will open (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Find-bar"

\end_inset

) and you can type in a text string.
 Alternatively you can hit Ctrl-F or select a text and hit Ctrl-F (a standard
 keystrokes binding, which can be configured, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Shortcuts"

\end_inset

).
 Pressing the up and down arrow will bring you to the next/previous occurrence
 of the search string.
 Hitting Enter has a similar effect as the down arrow.
 Hitting Escape will closes the find bar and sets the cursor to the current
 find position.
 You have options for case sensitive search (labeled 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

c.S.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), for searching only whole worlds (toggle Words) and for wrapping around
 (button Wrap), which means that the search will start at the beginning/end
 of the file, when the end/beginning is reached.
 If their is no occurrence of the search string in the currently open file
 the entry turns red.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
<<needs an uniform convention how to write key strokes>>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can search for regular expressions by switching on the Regex option.
 Leksah supports regular expressions in the Posix style (by using the regex-posi
x package).
 When the syntax of regular expressions is not legal, the background of
 the find pane turns orange.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Searching in all files in the package is often useful (another method is
 using the metadata, which is often more convenient and faster!) For this
 feature the grep program must be on your path.
 You can then enter a search string in the find bar and search for all occurrenc
es for the string in the folder and sub-folder of the current package with
 pressing the Grep button.
 A pane will open (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When using Source Candy, Leksah reads and writes pure ASCII Code files,
 but can nevertheless show you nice symbols like 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda.$
\end_inset

This is done by replacing certain character combinations by a Unicode character
 when loading a file or when typing, and replace it back when the file is
 saved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The use of the candy feature can be switched on and off in the menu and
 the preferences dialog.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This feature can be configured by editing a .candy file in the .leksah folder
 or in the data folder.
 The name of the candy file to be used can be specified in the Preferences
 dialog.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first entry in a line are the characters to replace.
 The second entry is the hexadecimal representation of the Unicode character
 to replace with.
 The third entry is an optional argument, which specifies, that the replacement
 should add and remove blanks to keep the number of characters.
 This is important because of the layout feature of Haskell.
 The last entry in the line is an optional comment, which is by convention
 the name of the Unicode character.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the source candy feature can give you problems with layout, because
 the alignment of characters with and without source candy may differ!

 Haskell organizes software projects in packages, which are managed independentl
y.
 A package is compiled and linked as a unit to produce one or more executables
 or/and a library.
 It is installed with the package manager (Cabal, cabal-install, ghc-pkg).
 A package can be uploaded to Hackage.
 And provided packages are downloaded from Hackage and installed.
 Packages have version numbers and specify version ranges for dependencies.
 Cabal assures that, if a packages is compiled, correct versions of other
 packages are selected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The difficulties, when working with a project where source code under developmen
t is spread over several packages, are overcome in Leksah with the concept
 of a workspace.
 It combines several packages and allows smooth working with files from
 all packages.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah always works in a workspace and always needs at least one package,
 to do anything useful.
 This seems overkill for very simple projects, where the workspace contains
 just one package and this package just one source module producing one
 executable, but Leksah provides defaults that reduce the effort to a minimum.
 The principle to always to work in a workspace and in a package is beneficial
 in the long run, because it gives a smooth transition from a one-shot idea
 to a complex projects and integrates the widely used cabal system fully.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah, in addition, saves the state of your work environment with a workspace:
 so you can switch between workspaces and get exactly back to where you
 stopped working when leaving the workspace: the same files open in editors
 and the cursor in the same file and position.
 When you open a workspace, and a session is attached to it, Leksah prompts
 you, if you want to switch to the session associated with the workspace.
 Leksah silently always saves the session for the workspace you are closing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have auto-build on and you change a file, Leksah detects if this
 file belongs to any project in your Workspace.
 If this is the case, it builds the package.
 So the source file you are working on, doesn't need to belong to the active
 package.
 Leksah will detect and compile the package for you.
 The active project is important for the menu items of the package menu,
 because they always work on the active package.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Background build can be permanently set in Prefs -> Build -> Background
 build.
 You can temporarily enable and disable it from the toolbar with this button:
 
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename ../pics/ide_build.png

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can set, if Leksah automatically save all files before building, by
 the setting Prefs -> Build -> Automatically save all files before building.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Linking can take a long time, and on Windows we can't interrupt the build
 process in the moment, so it may be an advantage to switch of linking.
 This can be done by: Prefs -> Build -> Include linking in background builds.
 You can temporarily enable and disable it from the toolbar with this button:
 
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename ../pics/ide_link.png

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The same option (disable linking) can be used to disable cross package build
 temporarily.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Cross package build
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following is valid in compiler mode: Depending on your settings the
 following may happen.
 After a library has been successfully build, it will be installed if:

\begin_layout Subsection
File Organization with Workspaces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A workspace is represented by a file (
\emph on
workspace_name.lkshws
\emph default
) in a directory.
 You may choose a hierarchical folder structure with a workspace file at
 the top and the projects in sub-folders for complex projects, but you can
 as well put all 
\emph on
workspaces
\emph default
 in one directory and put all packages flat.
 You have to use care when you create a new workspace file.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each package directory contains at least a cabal file (
\emph on
packagename.cabal
\emph default
) and typically folders for the source files, following the usual Haskell
 ghc convention of hierarchical module names.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cabal controls the compilation and linking of packages with GHC and puts
 the results in a dist folder in the package; this folder is reconstructed
 often and may be deleted without loss.
 In the folder package_name/dist/build/executable_name you find the executable,
 but it is also installed in the folder ?/.cabal/bin (which you want to put
 on your search path).

 When opening a Workspace you can choose to 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Clean and make workspace
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A workspace can be cleaned, meaning all packages gets cleaned and must be
 recompiled from scratch.
 Make builds all the packages in a meaningful order, and installs libraries
 if needed.
 It only stops if an error occurs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Jump between errors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are menu items to move to the next or the previous error the compiler
 found.
 You can as well use keyboard shortcuts for this: 
\noun on
ctr-j
\noun default
 and 
\noun on
shift-ctrl-j
\noun default
.
 It is as well possible to move by pointing to the error messages in the
 log pane or error pane.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Notion of active package
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the package pane a package can be marked as active either with the pop-up
 menu or by double clicking.
 The active package is the one that the commands in the Package menu refers
 to.
 (e.g.
 configure, build, install).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Packages
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The concept of a package is used to handle a unit of work for the development
 of some library or executable.
 It is, in the first place, the unit Cabal deals with and is a standard
 in the Haskell community.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah stores data for packages in the standard cabal files.
 The same files can be used outside of leksah: for example, you can issue
 the command cabal install in the folder that contains the cabal file and
 cabal will (as it would inside leksah) configures, compiles and links and
 install or register the library or executable produced.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Opening and closing a package
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah uses Cabal for package management, and opening a package is done
 by opening the corresponding .
\emph on
cabal
\emph default
 file.
 So when you select Package / Open Package from the menu, select the *.cabal
 file of the desired package.
 You must not have more than one *.cabal file in a folder!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah shows the currently active package in the third compartment in the
 status bar and in the window title.
 The package file contains appropriate defaults and for a small program,
 you may just save and close it.

The package editor (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

) is an editor for cabal files and but you can edit the cabal files in your
 regular text editor as well.
 Leksah works (usually) with the cabal files you and others have already
 written, for example those you get when you install a package from Hackage.
 Since cabal files offer complex options the editor offers many separate
 sub-panes in a list on the right.
 For a complete description of all options see the

\begin_layout Standard
The package editor does currently not support the cabal configurations feature.
 If you need cabal configurations, you need to edit the cabal files as a
 text file separately.
 Leksah uses standard cabal files with no modifications this is no problem
 just the package editor will not work for you.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The most important parts of cabal files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A package has, as a minimal requirement, a 
\bar under
name
\bar default
 and a 
\bar under
version
\bar default
 (default is 0.0.1 -- meaning something like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

first idea
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 If your code uses other packages then they must be listed in 
\bar under
dependencies
\bar default
.
 This will be at least the 
\emph on
base
\emph default
 package (which is entered by default).
 This is independent whether you downloaded them, e.g., from Hackage produced
 them yourself.
 Version numbers are used to document (and enforce) that older versions
 of a program use the corresponding older versions of other packages with
 which it was developed originally.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The result of the packages can be an executable and you enter the name of
 the Haskell file that contains the main function in the executable pane
 and the name of the executable.
 The result of the package can be a library; in the corresponding pane you
 tick off the modules which should be exposed (i.e., their exports can be
 used in other packages).
 Cabal gives the possibility to build more then one executable from one
 package and to build a library and executables from one package.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You have to specify a build info.
 With build information you give additional 
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

information, e.g: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
where the sources can be found (relative to the root folder of the project,
 which is the one with the cabal file).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
what additional non-exposed or non main modules your project includes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
compiler flags
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
used language extensions in addition to Haskell 98 (These can also be specified
 in the source files with pragmas)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
and many more ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because more then one executable and a library can be build from one package,
 it is possible to have cabal files with more then one build info.
 The package editor deals with this by the buttons Add / Remove Build Info.
 Every build info gets an index number, and for executables and a library
 you specify the index of the build info.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Initializing a package: Clean and configure operations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before a package can be acted on it must be configured; you may clean a
 package (i.e., delete its 
\emph on
dist
\emph default
 folder) to start afresh.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Configure checks that the packages the current packages depend on are installed
 in GHC package manager; it checks for name and version, if you specify
 them.
 If an Hackage package is missing, you can 
\noun on
cabal install
\noun default
 it in a terminal window.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two types of errors regarding packages may be reported:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While configuring, Cabal checks that the packages you have listed in the
 depends on section are installed on your computer.
 If one of your packages is missing (or missing the version that is needed)
 you can install it either -- for packages you have the source on your computer,
 e.g.
 because you wrote them -- by switching Leksah to the folder where this
 package is and configure, build and install them with the command 
\emph on
cabal install
\emph default
.
 For packages that are on Hackage -- use a console, go to the directory
 where you keep such sources and type cabal install packageName (possibly
 package_name-version); cabal then recursively installs the package and
 all packages it depends on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Separate from this error message the case, where the compiler misses a module
 you want to import.
 Ghc provides an error message, indicating what package you have to add
 to the depends on' section in the cabal file.
 Edit the package, add the dependency and do configure/build.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You have to take care as well, that their is a user and a global package
 db.
 Leksah uses the --user flag by default, to minimize errors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Building
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most frequently used functionality with packages is to make a build.
 If the package was not configured before, Leksah does that step automatically.
 When you start a build, you can see the standard output of the Cabal build
 procedure in the Log pane.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A build may produce errors and warnings.
 If this is the case the focus is set to the first error/warning in the
 Log and the corresponding source file will open with the focus at the point
 where the compiler reports the error.
 You can navigate to the next or previous errors by clicking on the error
 or warning in the log window, or by using the menu, the toolbar or a keystroke.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the statusbar the state regarding to the build is displayed in the third
 compartment from the right.
 It reads 
\emph on
Building
\emph default
 as long as a build is on the way and displays the numbers of errors and
 warnings after a build.

Background build
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah can run builds while you work and highlight errors as it finds them.
 This works with a timer that runs continuously in the background.
 If there are changes made to any open file it \SpecialChar \ldots{}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
interrupts any running build by sending SIGINT (this step is OS X and Linux
 only at this point, it's not working on MS Windows)

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Current limitation: Because we can't interrupt the build on windows there
 is an option in the Leksah build preferences to have it skip the linking
 stage in background builds.
 This reduces the delay before a next build starts.
 Background build and linking can be configured in the preferences and as
 well switched on and off from the toolbar.

 item in the package menu).
 For each of these operations you can enter the specific flags they require

 We give here two often examples of flags, others work similarly and we
 recommend that you consult the respective documentations.

\begin_layout Standard
Cabal needs the --user flag (which is set by default in Leksah) to install
 the result of a built in the user package database (the alternative is
 --global to put the resulting files in global space in ghc-pkg).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Haddock documentation for the leksah source will not be build, because it
 is not a library unless you pass the --executable flag.
 The flags are stored in a file called IDE.flags in the root folder of the
 project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Import Helper
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A frequent and annoying error is the 
\noun on
Not in scope
\noun default
 compiler error.
 In the majority of cases it means that an import statement is missing and
 to write import statements is a frequent and annoying task.
 In Leksah if the compiler informs about a missing import, you can choose
 
\emph on
Add import 
\emph default
from the context menu in the log pane.
 Leksah will then add an import statement to the import list.
 If there is more then one module that exports this identifier, a dialog
 will appear which queries you about the module you want to import from
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Leksah then adds a line or an entry to the import list of the affected module
 with the compiler error.
 Leksah imports individual elements, but imports all elements of a class

 The import helper can work with qualified identifiers and will add a correct
 import statement.

\begin_layout Standard
Obviously some not in scope errors have other reasons, e.g.
 you have misspelled some identifier, which can't be resolved by adding
 imports.
 After adding all imports, you have to save the file and then start a new

Leksah collects data about the modules of all installed Haskell packages
 on your system.
 It does this by reading the Haskell interface files .hi files (from GHC).
 It as well collects source positions and comments from sources.
 For this it looks in the source directories you specified in the preferences
 and downloads and unpacks sources from Hackage depending on your settings.
 Starting from the current version, Leksah can as well use prebuild metadata
 it might find on the web, to provide metadata for packages you have sources
 for, but the call to the Haddock library fails for some reason.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The packages in the workspace are treated differently, as not only external
 exported entities are collected, but all exports from all modules are collected.
 As well identifiers, which are not exported from a module get listed.
 The source symbol for them is shown in gray.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This metadata is used to answer questions like: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Which packages and modules export this identifier?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
What is the type of the exported identifier?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the source was found, it lists as well : 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The comment for this identifier 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
and can mark the item in the source file at the correct position
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you like to get information about some identifier in the code, the easiest
 way is to press 
\noun on
Ctrl 
\noun default
and
\noun on
 double click
\noun default
 on it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More precisely the operation starts with a release of the left mouse button
 with a selection with 
\noun on
Ctrl
\noun default
 pressed; You can use this if the double click doesn't select the intended
 area.
 If the identifier is known unambiguously the modules and info pane will
 show information about it.
 If more then one possibility exist the search pane will open and present
 the alternatives.
\end_layout

The Info Pane (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Info-pane"

\end_inset

) shows information about an interface element, which may be a function,
 a class, a data definition, a type (selected, for example, in the modules
 pane).
 It shows the identifier, the package and module that it is exported by,
 it's Haskell type and, if found, the Haddock documentation inserted in
 the source as a comment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you select and initiate an identifier search in an editor pane, the informati
on about this identifier is automatically displayed in the info pane (maybe
 nothing!).
 The easiest way to do this is to double click on an identifier while pressing
 
\noun on
Ctrl
\noun default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Only previously collected metadata is available this way.
 If the item has changed you could initiate an update of the information
 collected with update workspace metadata (menu configuration → update workspace
 data, or Ctrl-m).

\end_inset

).
 You can choose:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The scope in which to search, which can be Package, Workspace or System.
 For Package and Workspace scopes you can search with or without imports,
 which gives 5 different scopes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The way the search is executed, which can be exact, prefix or as a regular
 expression.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You can choose if the search shall be case sensitive or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The result of the search is displayed in the list part of the Search pane.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can see if the module reexports the identifier, or if the source of
 the identifier is reachable.
 When you single click on a search result, the module browser shows the
 corresponding information.
 If you double click on an entry, the modules and info pane shows the correspond
ing information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you double click on an identifier while pressing Ctrl in an editor pane,
 a case sensitive and exact search in the is started.

Metadata collection

\begin_layout Standard
Remember, that metadata is the data Leksah has collected from all the Haskell
 code (including .hi files for installed packages) it could reach on your
 computer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The initial path may take a long time (some minutes); when Leksah starts
 later, it checks only for changes, but does not scan all files again.
 Metadata collection depends on the local configuration, especially the
 list of places where Haskell code may be found, which is entered in the
 preferences.
 Occasionally, you may find it useful to rebuild the metadata.

\begin_layout Standard
Metadata collection can be manually triggered: If you select
\emph on
 Configuration -> Update workspace data
\emph default
, the metadata for the current project is collected.
 This brings the metadata of the current project up-to-date.
 You can as well press Ctrl-m or hit this symbol in the toolbar: 
\begin_inset Graphics

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you select

 Leksah checks, if a new library has been installed and then collects metadata
 for additions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you select 
\emph on
Configuration -> Rebuild system data,
\emph default
 Leksah rebuilds all metadata, which may take a long time.
 Currently the preferred way to do this is to call leksah-server -rbo +RTS
 -N2 from the command line.
 The reason for this is that the server process may allocate a lot of memory
 during collection.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Background infos
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The metadata collection itself proceeds different for workspace and system
 packages:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For workspace packages Leksah just uses the parser without typechecking
 and maybe .hi files if available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For system packages Leksah uses .hi files and if sources are available Haddock
 as a library.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Collection for system packages works as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Packages you installed with cabal from Hackage.
 If Leksah can't find sources, it does a 
\emph on
cabal unpack
\emph default
 in the source directory you specified for this in the preferences (By default
 .
\emph on
leksah-**/packageSources
\emph default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Source files in the folders listed as source folder in the preferences.
 Leksah looks for all .cabal files it can find below the source folders.
 Therefore, Leksah collects source information only from 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Cabalized
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 projects (i.e., projects that have a .cabal file).
 From this information the file source_packages.txt in the .leksah folder
 is written.
 If you miss sources for a package in Leksah, consult this file if the source
 place of the package has been correctly found.
 You can run this step by typing in a terminal: 
\emph on
leksah-server -o
\emph default
 (or 
\emph on
--
\emph default
sources).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Problems may occur due to preprocessing, header files, language extensions,
 etc.
 Error message produced while metadata collection indicate that not all
 information for a package was found.
 If the Haddock call doesn't succeed, Leksah looks if it can download a
 prebuild metadata package from the server, if this option is selected in
 the preferences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The result of metadata collection is stored in the folder 
\emph on
.leksah-*.*/metadata
\emph default
 in files called 
\emph on
*.lkshm.

\emph default
 In this folder for every package a metadata file is stored (e.g.
 binary-0.4.1.lkshm).
 These files are in binary format.
 If you want to rebuild just one package you can delete it here and update
 the system metadata.
 The files .lkshe specify the base path to sources, if the collection for
 sources was successfully or if a metdata file could be downloaded for this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the workspace packages a different procedure is used.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Metadata is collected from the source directories of the packages you are
 working on.
 The results are stored in a per module base in a folder with the package
 name (
\emph on
e.g .leksah-*.*/metadata/package-*.*.*).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Update happens on a per file base only for changed source files.

 What follows here is not needed for initial use of Leksah (and need not
 be read on a first lecture of the manual).
 Leksah works well with the default settings and a desire to adapt better
 to your work habits comes only with extended use of Leksah.
 However, with time, you may use one or the other option to tailor Leksah
 to your personal preference.
 It is easy! Here it is explained how this works.

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah has always one special pane, which is called the active pane, and
 its name is displayed in the second compartment from the left side in the
 status bar.
 Some actions like moving, splitting, closing panes or finding or replacing
 items in a text buffer act on the current pane, so check the display in
 the status bar to see if the pane you want to act on, is really the active
 one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can tailor the layout with the View menu to suit your work style better.
 Internally, the panes are arranged in a layout of a binary tree, where
 the leaves are horizontal or vertical splits.
 Every area can be split horizontally or vertically and panes can collapse.
 With the commands in the View menu you manipulate this tree to change the
 layout.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the initial pane positions part of the Preferences, you can configure
 the placement of panes.
 Panes belongs to categories, and a category specify a path were a pane
 will open (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The layout of the Leksah window contains areas which contain notebooks which
 contain panes.
 The division between the two areas is adjustable by the user by dragging
 a handle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Panes can be moved between areas in the window.
 This can be done by dragging the notebook tab, and release it on the frame
 of another notebook.
 Alternatively you can use keystrokes (Shift Alt Arrow) to move panes around.
 The tabs of notebooks can be positioned at any of the four directions,
 or the tabs can be switched off.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that holding the mouse over the tabs and selecting the right button
 brings up a menu of all panes in this area, so that you can for example
 quickly select one of many open source buffers.

Advanced layout: Group panes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A notebook cannot only contain single panes, but it can as well contain
 group panes, which have a layout on their own and may contain arbitrary
 other panes; the debug pane is an example for a group pane.
 This gives you the possibility to arrange the subpanes in a debugger pane
 as it fits you best.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A new group starts by selecting 
\noun on
View / Group 
\noun default
from the menu.
 You have to give a unique name for the group.
 Then you can arrange panes in the group as you like.
 When closing a group, and the group is not empty, you have to confirm it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Using Leksah with multiple displays: Detached windows
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This feature allows you to move panes to a separate window on a separate
 display.
 This is as simple as: You select a notebook and choose 
\noun on
View / Detach
\noun default
 from the menu bar.
 Then the notebook is opened in a new window, which you can then move to
 another screen.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you close the detached window, the pane goes back to the place where
 it was before detaching.
 The state of detached window is remembered, when you close Leksah, and
 they will be reopened when you restart Leksah.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to drag and drop panes between windows.
 But splitting and collapsing of panes is disabled for detached windows.
 So a recommended way to use this feature is to split a pane, arrange the
 panes that you want to detach in the area of the new notebook.
 Select the new notebook and detach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The detached windows have no menu bar, toolbar and status bar on their own.
 This may be a problem, when you want to select a menu entry: the focus
 changes from a pane in the detached window to a pane in the main window,
 and you may not be able to do what you want.
 We recommend that you use keystrokes or context menus.

When you close Leksah the current state is saved in the file 
\emph on
current.lksks
\emph default
 in the 
\emph on
~/.leksah-*.*
\emph default
 folder.
 A session contains the layout of the window, its content, the active package
 and some other state.
 When you restart Leksah it recovers the state from this information.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you close a workspace, the session is saved in the folder of the workspace
 
\emph on
in 
\emph default
a file named
\emph on
 workspacename.lksks
\emph default
.
 When you open a workspace and Leksah finds a 
\emph on
workspacename.lksks
\emph default
 file together with the workspace file you are going to open, you get prompted
 if you want to open this session (this means mostly opening the files you
 had open before in the editor).
 This helps you to switch between different workspaces you are working on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, sessions can be stored and loaded with a name manually by using
 the session menu, but the need to use these features occurs rarely.
 The menu Configuration -> Forget Session is useful if you inadvertently
 changed the layout drastically and do not want the current session to be
 stored.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can configure the keystrokes by providing a keymap file, which should
 be be in the ~/.leksah-0.8 folder.
 The name of the key map file to be used can be specified in the Preferences
 dialog (without extension!).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A line in the .keymap file looks like:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
<ctrl>o -> FileOpen "Opens an existing file"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Description of the key or key combination: Allowed modifiers are <shift>
 <ctrl> <alt> <apple> <compose>.
 <apple> is on a Microsoft keyboard the windows key (and on a Mac, obviously,
 the apple key!).
 <compose> is right ALT key, often labeled Alt Gr.
 It is as well possible to specify Emacs like keystrokes in the following
 way: <ctrl>x/<ctrl>f -> FileOpen "Opens an existing file"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The name of the action can be any one of the 
\emph on

\emph default
 function in the Module 
\emph on

\emph default
Command.
 The comment following will be displayed as tool tip for the toolbar button,
 if one exists for this action.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every keystroke must at most be associated with one action, and every action
 may only have one associated keystroke.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simple keystrokes are shown in the menu, but Emacs like keystrokes are not.
 This is because simple keystrokes are handled by the standard GTK mechanism,
 while other keystrokes are handled by Leksah.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Independently how you initiated an action, by a menu, a toolbar button or
 a keystroke, the keystroke with its associated ActionsString is displayed
 in the Status bar in the leftmost compartment.

 Indexing the hidden Leksah directory with the version number avoids that
 changes to preferences file layout from version to version cause difficulties.
 Moving your preferences from a previous version can potentially be automatic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The file 
\emph on
prefs.lkshp
\emph default
 stores the general preferences.
 It is a text file you could edit with a text editor, but more comfortable
 and safer is to do it in Leksah with the menu 
\noun on
Configuration / Edit Prefs
\noun default
 from the menu.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If no preference file is found in your the .leksah-*.* folder then the global
 prefs.lkshp in the installed data folder will be used.
 If a preference file get corrupted, which means Leksah does not start;
 it is then often sufficient to just delete the preference file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The source_packages.txt file stores source locations for installed packages.
 It can be rebuild by calling leksah-server in a terminal with the -o or
 --sources argument .
 Do this after you moved your source or added sources for previous installed
 packages without sources.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Files for Keymaps (keymap.lkshk) and SourceCandy(candy.lkshc) may be stored
 in the ~/.leksah-*.* folder and will be found according to the name selected
 in the Preferences Dialog.
 Leksah first searches in this folder and after this in the /data folder.

The Leksah Project
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The development of an integrated Development Environment is a major undertaking
 and Leksah should become increasingly supported by the user community.
 If you are a user or just test Leksah, we would appreciate to here from
 you.
 Do not miss to report bugs, unclear or wrong information in the documentation
 and suggestion for improvements on the Leksah issue tracker.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Everyone is invited to contribute.
 Spreading the word, supplying error reports, providing keymap and candy
 files, providing a tutorial, caring for a platform will develop are all
 helpful and meaningful ways to contribute.
