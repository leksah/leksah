\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for the programming
 language Haskell.
 It is written in Haskell.
 Leksah is intended as a practical tool to support the Haskell development
 process.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah uses GTK+ as GUI Toolkit with the gtk2hs binding.
 It is platform independent and should run on any platform where GTK+, gtk2hs
 and GHC can be installed.
 It is tested on Linux, Windows and Mac.
 It uses the Cabal package management and build system for Package Management.
 It needs the Glasgow Haskell Compiler for full functionality (GHC).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This document is a reference to the functionality of Leksah, it is not intended
 to be a tutorial.
 Since Leksah is in the state of development the information may be incomplete
 or even wrong.

\begin_layout Subsection
Release Notes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Version 0.6 Beta Release Juli 2009
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 0.6 version introduces an interpreter/debugger mode.
 This mode can be switched on and off from the toolbar.
 In interpreter/debugger mode expressions can be evaluated and the type
 of expressions can be dynamically shown.
 The GHCi debugger is integrated, so that breakpoints can be set, it is
 possible to step through the code, observe the values of variables and
 trace the execution history.
 The other features of Leksah like building in the background and reporting
 errors on the fly work in debugger mode as in compiler mode.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another new feature is integration of grep and text search with regular
 expression.
 This can be accessed from the findbar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GUI framework has been enhanced, so that layouts can be nested in so
 called group panes.
 This feature is used for the debugger pane.
 Furthermore notebooks can be detached, so that Leksah can be used on multiple
 screens.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A lot of little enhancements has been made and numerous bugs has been fixed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Known bugs and problems:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The package editor works only for cabal files without configurations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
MS Windows: The check for external modifications of source files does not
 work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
MS Windows: Interruption of a background build does not work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
GUI History still not working.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Traces pane of the Debugger does not work appropriately.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Version 0.4 Beta Release February/March 2009
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 0.4 Release is the first beta release of Leksah.
 It should be usable for practical work for the ones that wants to engage
 with it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It depends on GHC 
\begin_inset Formula $\geq$
\end_inset

6.10.1 and gtk2hs 
\begin_inset Formula $\geq$
\end_inset

 0.10.0.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The class pane and the history feature are not quite ready, so we propose
 not to use it yet.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Version 0.1 Alpha Release February 2008 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a pre-release of Leksah.
 The editor for Cabal Files is not ready, so we propose not to use it yet.

\begin_layout Section
Installing Leksah
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
It is a good idea to install sources for your Haskell libraries when using
 Leksah
\series default
.
 Leksah can then give you much better information from Metadata.
 Installing with 
\emph on
cabal install
\emph default
 will do that, and you can download the sources for GHC even after you installed
 it from a binary package.
 However compiling from sources is necessary for special packages, which
 perform some special magic, like generating header files or such.
 With sources installed Leksah will show you source comments for functions
 while auto-completing and will be navigate you to the sources of functions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have any trouble installing and this manual will not help, please
 check the Wiki, the mailing list or contact the developers to find a solution.
 If it is a Leksah problem, then it is important to us and needs to be fixed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
We work on installers for Windows and Mac and packages for Debian/Ubuntu
 are in preparation.
 Further help needed! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Generic Installation Instructions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Install GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the time of writing Leksah supports GHC in the versions (6.10.*).
 For information about installing GHC go to 
\begin_inset Flex URL
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://haskell.org/ghc
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Install Cabal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the time of writing Leksah requires at least version 1.6.0.1.
 For information about installing Gtk2Hs got to 
\begin_inset Flex URL
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://haskell.org/cabal
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On operating systems with package managers you may find that a Cabal package
 is available.
 Once again if you want good Metadata for the Cabal functions, try to build
 binaries on your machine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Install Gtk2Hs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the time of writing Leksah supports only the most current version (0.10.*).
 For information about installing Gtk2Hs got to 
\begin_inset Flex URL
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://haskell.org/gtk2hs
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are planning on installing a newer version, then you will need to
 make sure it is compatible with the version of GHC you have installed first.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On operating systems with a package manager you may wish to use a source
 OS package and build a binary OS package to install.
 You should be able to prevent the working directory from being cleaned,
 so it can be used for Leksah's Metadata.
 Doing this means that other OS packages depending on Gtk2Hs can still easily
 be installed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you compile Gtk2Hs manually, check the output of ./configure.
 At the end it will list the Haskell packages that are going to be build.
 Leksah needs GTK, glib and gtksourceview2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gtk2Hs conditionally compiles some code dependent of the version of the
 underlying GTK libraries.
 This can cause strange compiler errors when compiling Leksah later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

 Then run 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 with typical Cabal procedure.
 (Go to the root folder of the package.
 Then do 
\emph on
runhaskell configure, runhaskell build, sudo runhaskell install
\emph default
.
 The other packages needed should have been installed with GHC anyway.
 (I'm nut sure if GHC-extralibs is needed).
 Then get the Leksah package via Hackage and do the same.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Where Things Are Installed
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah installs a an executable in a folder that should be in the search
 path, and a couple of data files in a data folder.
 These places are chosen by the Cabal package management system and depend
 on the target platform and the way you install.
 On Linux the data folder may be
\emph on
 /usr/share/leksah-0.4/data.
 
\emph default
For storing preferences, sessions and collected meta-data Leksah constructs
 a .leksah directory in your home folder.
 If you want to change or add configuration files for keymaps, source candy,
 etc, you can put them in this place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Post installation steps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you 
\emph on
upgrade
\emph default
 to version 0.6 you should clean the Current.session and maybe the Default.prefs
 file from your .leksah configuration folder.
 This means that you loose your personal settings.
 As well you should clean the IDE.session files from the project folders
 you are working on (or at least avoid to open them when prompted).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you use a customized keymap in your .leksah folder, you need to append
 new keybindings.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
\color red
New
\series default
\color inherit
 With version 0.6 for a pleasant visual appearance, you have to copy or append
 the .gtkrc-2.0 file from the Leksah data folder or from the data folder in
 Leksah sources to your home folder.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
OS X (using MacPorts)

In the future I hope we can provide a Windows installer.
 For now the situation is difficult, because the

latest gtk2hs Windows installer that works for Leksah is 0.10.0, which only
 works with GHC 6.10.2
\color inherit
.
 Build 0.10.1 of gtk2hs has an issue with the the GTKSourceView2 component.
 A windows installer for GHC 6.10.4 is missing.
 Please write to the gtk2hs users mailing list if you want this situation
 to improve.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The central functionality needed for development is to edit Haskell source
 files.
 Leksah uses the GtkSourceView2 widget for this.
 It provides editing, undo/redo, syntax highlighting and other features.
 In the file menu (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:File-menu"

\end_inset

) you have the usual functionality to open, save, close and revert files.
 You can as well close all files, and all files which are not stored in
 or below the top folder of the current project (this is the folder where
 the .cabal file resides).
 Leksah does not store backup files.
 Leksah detects if a file has changed which is currently edited and queries
 the user if a reload is desired.
 When you open a file which is already open, leksah queries if you want
 to make the currently open file active, instead of opening it a second
 time (Leksah does not support multiple views on a file, but if you open
 a file a second time, it's like editing the file two times, which makes
 little sense).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a file has changed compared to the stored version, the file name is
 shown in red in the notebook tab.
 If you want to change to a different buffer you can open a list of all
 open buffers by pressing the right mouse button, while the mouse is over
 a notebook tab.
 You can then select an entry in this list to select this file.
 (See 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Using-the-Flipper"

\end_inset

 for a better way to switch between source files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the right side in the status bar you can see the line and column, in
 which the cursor currently is; and if overwrite mode is switched on.
 In the second compartment from the left you can see the currently active
 pane, which is helpful if you want to be sure that you have selected the
 right pane for some operation.

 In addition you can comment and un-comment selected lines in a per line
 style (--).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore you can align some special characters (=,<-,->,::,|) in selected
 lines.
 The characters are never moved to the left, but the operation is very simple
 and takes the rightmost position of the special character in all lines,
 and inserts spaces before the first occurrence of this special characters
 in the other lines for alignment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Find and Replace
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah supports searching in text files.
 When you select Edit/Find from the menu the find bar will open (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Find-bar"

\end_inset

) and you can type in a text string.
 Alternatively you can hit Ctrl-F or select a text and hit Ctrl-F (This
 is a standard keystrokes.
 Keystrokes can be configures, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Shortcuts"

\end_inset

).
 Hitting the up and down arrow will bring you to the next/previous occurrence
 of the search string.
 Hitting Enter has a similar effect as the down arrow.
 Hitting Escape will closes the find bar and sets the cursor to the current
 find position.
 You have options for case sensitive search(c.S.), for searching only whole
 worlds (Words) and for wrapping around (Wrap), which means that the search
 will start at the beginning/end of the file, when the end/beginning is
 reached.
 If their is no occurrence of the search string the entry turns red.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can search for regular expressions by switching on the Regex option.
 Leksah supports regular expressions in the Posix style (by using the regex-posi
x package).
 When the syntax of regular expressions is not legal, the background of
 the find pane turns orange.

For this feature the grep program must be on your path.
 You can then enter a search string in the find bar and hit the Grep button.
 This will search for all occurrences for the string in the folder and subfolder
 of the current package.
 Greps supports the search for regular expressions.
 A pane will open (

When using Source Candy, Leksah reads and writes pure ASCII Code files,
 but can nevertheless show you nice symbols like

This is done by replacing certain character combinations by a Unicode character
 when loading a file or when typing, and replace it back when the file is

The first entry in a line are the characters to replace.
 The second entry is the hexadecimal representation of the Unicode character
 to replace with.
 The third entry is an optional argument, which specifies, that the replacement
 should add and remove blanks to keep the number of characters.
 This is important because of the layout feature of Haskell.
 The last entry in the line is an optional comment, which is by convention
 the name of the Unicode character.

Leksah does not only support editing Haskell source files, but as well building
 the application or program you are developing.
 The concept of a package is used to handle a unit of work for the development
 of some library or executable.
 One instance of Leksah can only open one package at a time.
 (It is a wish of many users to make this more flexible in the way of e.g.
 Eclipse Workspaces).
 Leksah can store configurations for packages separately (and does this
 by default), so that you can switch between packages and get exactly back
 to where you stopped when opening a different package.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah uses Cabal for package management, and opening a package is done
 by opening a .cabal file.
 So when you select Package / Open Package from the menu, select the *.cabal
 file of the desired package.
 Leksah shows the currently active package in the third compartment in the
 status bar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To start with a new package select Package / NewPackage from the menu.
 Then you have to select a folder for the project, this is by convention
 the same name you will give to your package.
 Then the package editor will open up, in which you have to supply information
 about your package.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Package Editor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The package editor (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Since cabal files offer complex options the editor is quite complex.
 For a complete description of all options see the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Cabal User's Guide"
target "http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/Cabal/index.html"

\end_inset

 The package editor does currently not support the cabal configurations
 feature.
 If you need cabal configurations, you need to edit the cabal files as a
 text file.
 Since Leksah uses standard cabal files with no modifications this is no
 problem, and you can use Leksah with such packages with no problem, just
 the package editor will not work for you.
 (We plan to enhance the editor to support configurations in the future).

The minimum requirements for any package is to give a name and a version.
 Then you will have to enter dependencies on other packages in the dependencies
 part of the editor.
 This will be at least the 
\emph on
base
\emph default
 package.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally you have to specify an executable or a library that should be the
 result of your coding effort.
 You do this in the Executable and Library part of the editor.
 Cabal gives the possibility to build more then one executable from one
 package and to build a library and executables from one package.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For an executable you enter a name, the source file with the main function
 and a build info.
 For a library you enter the exposed modules and a build info.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With build information you give additional 
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

information, e.g: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
where the sources can be found (relative to the root folder of the project,
 which is the one with the cabal file).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
and many more ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because more then one executable and a library can be build from one package,
 it is possible to have cabal files with more then one build info.
 The package editor deals with this by the buttons Add / Remove Build Info.
 Every build info gets an index number, and for executables and a library
 you specify the index of the build info.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Building
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most frequently used functionality with packages is to make a build,
 which is possible after a successful configure.
 When you start a build, you can see the standard output of the Cabal build
 procedure in the Log pane.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A build may produce errors and warnings.
 If this is the case the focus is set to the first error/warning in the
 Log and the corresponding source file will open with the focus at the point
 where the compiler reports the error.
 You can navigate to the next or previous errors by clicking on the error
 or warning in the log window, or by using the menu, the toolbar or a keystroke.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the statusbar the state regarding to the build is displayed in the third

 It reads

 warnings after a build.

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah can run builds while you work and highlight errors as it finds them.
 This works with a timer that runs continuously in the background.
 If there are changes made to any open file it \SpecialChar \ldots{}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because we can't interrupt the build on windows there is an option in the
 Leksah build preferences to have it skip the linking stage in background
 builds.
 This reduces the delay before a next build starts.
 Background build and linking can be configured in the preferences and as

As you can see in the package menu (

\end_inset

) you can do more operations with packages, which are mostly provided by
 the Cabal system.
 You can clean, configure, build and if you have build an executable run
 your program.
 And other operations like building a source distribution and building haddock
 documentation.
 For more details about these operations (as said before) consult the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since many of these operations can take additional flags you can enter these
 by selecting Package / Edit flags.
 Then the Flags pane opens up (Figure 12).
 For example haddock documentation for the leksah source will not be build,
 because it is not a library unless you pass the --executable flag.
 The flags are stored in a file called IDE.flags in the root folder of the
 project.

from the context menu in the log pane.
 Leksah will then add an import statement to the import list.

Leksah collects data about the exported modules of all installed Haskell
 packages on your system.
 It does this by reading the Haskell interface files (from GHC).
 In addition it adds source positions and comments of packages, for which
 a cabal file with the corresponding source files can be found.
 The package you work on is treated differently, as not only external exported
 entities are collected, but all exports from all modules are collected.
 This makes it possible to get information about identifiers: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Which packages and modules export this identifier?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
What is the sort of the exported identifier?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the source was found: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
What is the comment for this identifier?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Where is the source with position?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you like to get information about some identifier in the code, the easiest
 way is to press 
\noun on
Ctrl and double click
\noun default
 on it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More precisely the operation is not triggered by the double click operation,
 but by the release of the left button.
 So if the double click does not select the right area for a special id
 like ++, you can select the desired characters with the left button and
 then release it while you hold down the Ctrl key.
 If the id is known unambiguously the modules and info pane will show informatio
n about it.
 If more then one possibility exist the search pane will open and present
 the alternatives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current Leksah metadata does not contain definitions local to a module.
 So names which are not exported will not be found in the metadata.
 We plan to change this for the current project for future versions.

Metadata collection depends on the configuration and can be manually triggered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you select Metadata / Update Project the metadata for the current project
 is collected from the .hi files and the source files.
 You should select this if the metadata of the current project is out of
 sync.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you select Metadata / Update Lib Leksah checks if a new library has installed
 and if this is the case collects metadata for it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Metadata part of the preferences (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Metadata-Preferences"

\end_inset

) you can edit the settings concerning metadata collection.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Metadata collection is a difficult point, because it depends on the installation
, environment, the installed packages, etc.
 However, to make good use of leksah it is highly desirable to have metadata
 with sources available for the packages you really need.
 So here we explain how metadata collection works:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Since cabal install has sources only as compressed tar archives on your
 machine, leksah needs to unpack this.
 You can see if this works by browsing the folders.
 You can initiate this step by calling leksah -x - n.
 If only root has write access to some cabal packages do a: sudo leksah
 -x -n (--Extract --NoGui).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Now leksah looks for all cabal files it can find below the source folders.
 From this information the file source_packages.txt in the .leksah folder
 is written.
 If you miss sources for a package in Leksah, consult this file if the source
 place of the package has been correctly found.
 You can run this step by: leksah -s -n (--Sources --NoGui).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The metadata collection itself proceeds in two steps: A) Extract info from
 .hi files, which is usually no problem.
 B) Add source locations and comments by parsing the sources.
 This can be a problem because of preprocessing, header files, language
 extensions, etc.
 The result is stored in a folder under the .leksah folder (under your home
 folder).
 The folder will be named after the compiler version (e.g.
 ghc-6.8.1).
 In this folder for every package a metadata file is stored (e.g.
 binary-0.4.1.pack).
 These files are in binary format.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

You can rebuild the whole metadata when you start Leksah with the -r -n
 option (--Rebuild --NoGui).
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

You can update the metadata with: leksah -c -n (--Collect --NoGui)
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

If you have a problem with a certain package, remove its metadata file ,
 e.g.
 rm ~/.leksah/ghc-.../binary*.
 And then do a collect: leksah -c -n.
 Look for error messages in the Console to see if some problem is reported.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For the current package a slightly different procedure is used, because
 leksah not only looks for exported library entities, but for all exports
 of every module.
 The written metadata file has the extension .packw.

In Leksah there may be an active pane.
 The name of this pane is displayed in the second compartment from the left

 Some actions like moving, splitting, closing panes or finding or replacing
 items in a text buffer act on the current pane, so check the display in
 the status bar to see if the pane you want to act on, is really the active
 one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The layout of the Leksah window contains areas which contain notebooks which
 contain so called panes.
 The division between the two areas is adjustable by the user by dragging
 a handle.
 The areas form a binary tree, although this tree is not visible to the
 user.
 Every area can be split horizontally or vertically.
 Panes can collapsed, the effect of collapsing depends on the position of
 the pane in the binary layout tree.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Panes can be moved between areas in the window.
 This can be done by dragging the notebook tab, and release it on the frame
 of another notebook.
 Alternatively you can use keystrokes (Shift Alt Arrow) to move panes around.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tabs of notebooks can be positioned at any of the four directions, or
 the tabs can be switched off.
 Note that holding the mouse over the tabs and selecting the right button
 brings up a menu of all panes in this area, so that you can for example
 quickly select one of many open source buffers.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Group panes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before we invented group panes, a notebook could only contain atomar panes.
 Now it can as well contain group panes, which have a layout on their own
 and may contain arbitary other panes.
 The debug pane is an example for a group pane.
 This gives you the possibility to arrange the subpanes in a debugger pane
 as it fits best for you.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can add a new group by selecting View / Group from the menubar.
 You have to give a unique name for any group.
 Then you can arrange panes in the group as you like.
 When closing a group, and the group is not empty, you have to confirm that
 this is what you really want.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Detached windows
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This feature is useful if you want to use Leksah on multiple screens.
 You can select a notebook and choose View / Detach from the menubar.
 Then this notebook is opened in a new window, which you can then move to
 another screen.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you close the detached window, the contents goes back to the place where
 it was before detaching.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you close Leksah, the state of detached window is remembered, and they
 will be reopened when you restart Leksah.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to drag and drop panes between windows.
 But splitting and collapsing of panes is disabled for detached windows.
 So a recommended way to use this feature is to split a pane, arrange the
 panes that you want to detach in the area of the new notebook.
 Select the new notebook and detach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The detached windows have no menubar, toolbar and statusbar on their own.
 This may be a problem, because when you want to select a menu entry, the
 focus may change from a pane in the detached window to a pane in the main
 window, and you may not be able to do what you want.
 However keystrokes works fine, and that is how we use this feature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a new addition in this release, and the handling of detachement
 may be a bit unconveniant.
 Let us know what you need.

\begin_layout Standard
When you close Leksah the current state is saved in the file Current.session
 in the ~/.leksah folder.
 A session contains the layout of the window, its population, the active
 package and some other state.
 When you restart Leksah it recovers the state from this information.
 When you close a package, the session is saved in the project folder in
 the file IDE.session.
 When you open a project and Leksah finds a IDE.session file in the folder
 of the project you are going to open, you get prompted if you want to open
 this session.
 This should help you to switch between different packages you are working
 on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beside of this you have the possibility to store and load named sessions
 manually by using the session menu.
 Actually you may live well without using this feature.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can as well choose to mark Forget Session, if you don't want the current
 session to be stored.
 This can be useful, if something goes wrong (e.g.
 you hit accidentally Ctrl - 0 and the layout collapses completely).

Shortcuts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can configure the keystrokes by providing a .keymap file, which can either
 be in the .leksah folder or in the data folder.
 The name of the key map file to be used can be specified in the Preferences
 dialog.
 A line in the .keymap file looks like:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
<ctrl>o -> FileOpen "Opens an existing file"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Allowed Modifiers are <shift> <ctrl> <alt> <apple> <compose>.
 <apple> is the Windows key on PC keyboards.
 <compose> is often labeled Alt Gr.
 It is as well possible to specify Emacs like keystrokes in the following
 way:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
<ctrl>x/<ctrl>f -> FileOpen "Opens an existing file"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The comment on the right will be displayed as tool tips on top of toolbar
 buttons, if such exist for this action.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The name of the action can be any one of the 
\emph on
ActionDescr's
\emph default
 given in the 
\emph on
action
\emph default
 function in the Module 
\emph on
IDE.Menu
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whenever you call an action, by a menu, a toolbar or a keystroke, the keystroke
 with its associated ActionsString is displayed in the Status bar in the
 leftmost compartment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every keystroke shall obviously only be associated with one action, and
 more important every action may only have one associated keystroke.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simple keystrokes are shown in the menu, but Emacs like keystrokes are not.
 This is because simple keystrokes are delegated to the standard GTK mechanism,
 while other keystrokes are handled by Leksah.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Configuration files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah stores its configuration in a directory called ~/.leksah under your
 home folder.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The file Default.prefs stores the general Preferences.
 These Preferences can be edited in a dialog by choosing Configuration /
 Edit Prefs from the menu.
 If this file is not available the Default.prefs file from the installed
 /data folder will be used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Current.session file stores the state of the last session, so that Leksah
 will recover the state from the last session.
 If this file is not available it will be taken from the installed /data
 folder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The source_packages.txt file stores source locations for installed packages.
 It can be rebuild by calling Leksah with the -s or --Sources argument .
 Do this after you moved your source or added sources for previous installed
 packages without sources.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The folder will contain one or many other folders (e.g.
 ghc-6.8.1).
 In this folder collected information about installed packages for a compiler
 version is stored.
 (e.g.
 binary-0.4.1.pack).
 These files are in binary format.
 If you start Leksah with the -r or --Rebuild argument, it cleans all .pack
 files and rebuilds everything.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Files for Keymaps and SourceCandy may be stored in the ~/.leksah folder and
 will be found according to the name selected in the Preferences Dialog.
 Leksah first searches in this folder and after this in the /data folder.
